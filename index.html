                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio! While it looks simple right now, I hope to build on it and eventually have a website that will show the full extent of my ability with web development, so be sure to come back every now and then to watch it grow. 
                </p>
                <h2>A litte bit about me:</h2>
                <p class="bio">
                    Despite my rather deceptive appearance, I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico but raised in Brownsville, Texas. I have a wide variety of hobbies; starting with more stereotypical ones like video games and ending with more atypical ones like Fire spinng and bartending. I consider myself extremely adapative to any scenario, as well as a quick learner. I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts after 12 years of work in 2013 and graduated from UT Austin in 2017 with a BA in Economic and certificates in Comptuer Science and International Business.         
                </p>
                <h2> Why do Web Development?</h2>
                <p class = "rest">
                    I've always had a knack for tinkering with various forms of software which is what lead to my interest in computer science as a whole. From there, I found my calling in web development. Watching a site come together bit by bit is an expierence that I could only dream of. I find it fascinating to see how simple text being written in an editor can build something that everyone uses in their day to day life.
